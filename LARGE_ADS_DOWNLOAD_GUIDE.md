# Download Large Ad Creatives - Complete Guide
**Date:** June 25, 2025  
**Issue:** GitHub URLs showing small 2KB thumbnails instead of large ad creatives  
**Goal:** Get high-quality, large ad creative files (videos/images)

## 🎯 The Problem

The current GitHub repository contains:
- ❌ Small 2KB thumbnails from Facebook CDN
- ❌ 175KB business login page screenshots
- ❌ Custom placeholder images

**What you need:** Large, high-quality original ad creative files (videos, high-res images)

## ✅ Solution Options

### **Option 1: Manual Download from Facebook Ads Manager (Fastest)**

1. **Go to Facebook Ads Manager**
   - Visit: https://business.facebook.com/
   - Login to your TurnedYellow account

2. **Navigate to Creative Library**
   - Click "Creative" in left sidebar
   - Or go to "Ads" → "Ad Creative"

3. **Find Your Ads by Name:**
   - "video: influencer David / Most incredible"
   - "🐸💛 TY Video 1 High Hook" 
   - "🦶 Bigfoot's Jungle Adventures"
   - "🐸❤️️ Royal Inspo Hook Strong"

4. **Download Original Files**
   - Click on each creative
   - Look for "Download" or "Export" button
   - Save as highest quality available (MP4 for videos, PNG/JPG for images)

5. **Upload to GitHub**
   - Save files to your local directory
   - I'll help upload them to GitHub repository

### **Option 2: Browser Automation (If Option 1 doesn't work)**

Use browser automation to download directly:

```bash
# Install browser automation tools
pip install playwright beautifulsoup4

# Run the download script
python download_ads_with_browser.py
```

### **Option 3: Meta API with Proper Token (Technical)**

Generate a new access token with proper permissions:

1. **Go to Facebook Graph API Explorer**
   - Visit: https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/
   - Select your app: "META Marketing Insights App"

2. **Generate Token with Permissions:**
   - `ads_read`
   - `ads_management`
   - `business_management`
   - `pages_read_engagement`

3. **Use the token in our script:**
   ```bash
   python download_large_ad_images.py
   ```

## 🎬 Expected File Sizes for Quality Ads

- **Video Ads (MP4):** 1-50 MB
- **High-res Images:** 100KB - 5MB
- **Standard Images:** 50-500KB

**Current thumbnails (2KB)** are too small for quality display.
