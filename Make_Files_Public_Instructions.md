# How to Make Google Drive Files Public
**Created: 2025-01-18**

## 🔒 Current Issue
The files I uploaded to your Google Drive are private by default. You need to change the sharing settings to make them publicly accessible.

## 📁 Files to Make Public:

### **Latest File (Recommended):**
🔗 **NEW FILE**: [PUBLIC_Enhanced_Video_Metrics_Both_Accounts_Last_3_Months.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YlZdXWHUSZFs73TEqQ43qtt3lGkZ2xWT/view?usp=drivesdk)

### **Original File:**
🔗 **ORIGINAL**: [Enhanced_Video_Metrics_Both_Accounts_Last_3_Months.csv](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rjDLgsr0HNj310dlksETk12Ssats_XK1/view?usp=drivesdk)

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Instructions:

### **Method 1: Make Public via Google Drive**

1. **Click on one of the links above** to open the file in Google Drive
2. **Right-click on the file** and select "Share" 
   OR click the **Share button** (👥 icon) in the top-right
3. **In the Share dialog:**
   - Click "Restricted" (currently only you can access)
   - Select **"Anyone with the link"**
   - Change permission from "Viewer" to **"Editor"** (for public editing)
4. **Click "Copy link"** to get the public shareable link
5. **Click "Done"**

### **Method 2: Make Public via File Menu**

1. **Open the file** in Google Drive
2. **Click File → Share → Share with others**
3. **Follow steps 3-5 above**

### **Method 3: Convert to Google Sheets (Recommended)**

For better collaborative editing:

1. **Open the CSV file** in Google Drive
2. **Click "Open with Google Sheets"**
3. **File → Make a copy** (this creates a new Google Sheets file)
4. **Share the new Google Sheets file** following Method 1 above
5. **Delete the original CSV** if desired

## ✅ Verification:

After making it public, the link should work in an incognito window or when shared with others.

## 🔗 What You'll Get:

Once public, you'll have:
- **Public view link**: Anyone can view the spreadsheet
- **Public edit link**: Anyone can edit the spreadsheet (if you chose "Editor")
- **Direct download link**: For CSV downloads

## 💡 Pro Tips:

1. **Use Google Sheets** instead of CSV for better collaboration
2. **Make it "Editor" access** so others can help fill in the video URLs
3. **Share the link** in your team chat or email
4. **Bookmark the link** for easy access

## 🚨 Security Note:

Making files public means anyone with the link can access them. Only do this for files that don't contain sensitive information.

**🎯 Goal**: Get a publicly accessible, editable spreadsheet with all your Facebook ad video metrics!
