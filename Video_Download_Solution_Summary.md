# Facebook Ad Video Download Solution

## üéØ Problem Solved
You wanted easier access to your Facebook ad videos instead of the `fb.me` links that redirect to Facebook. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Provided

### **Automated Download & Google Drive Upload Script**
I've created a comprehensive solution that:

1. **Extracts real video URLs** from Meta's API (not redirect links)
2. **Downloads videos locally** with proper filenames
3. **Uploads to Google Drive** automatically
4. **Updates your spreadsheet** with direct download links
5. **Cleans up local files** to save space

### **Files Created:**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `video_downloader_to_gdrive.py` | Main script that processes all videos |
| `configure_tokens.py` | Helper to set up Meta token & Google Drive folder |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies needed |
| `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` | Complete setup guide |
| `Enhanced_Video_Metrics_Both_Accounts_Last_3_Months.csv` | Updated spreadsheet with new columns |

### **New Spreadsheet Columns Added:**

- **`Facebook_Link`**: Original fb.me redirect links
- **`Meta_Video_URL`**: Direct video URL from Meta API
- **`GDrive_Download_Link`**: Direct download from Google Drive
- **`GDrive_View_Link`**: Viewable link in Google Drive

## üöÄ How to Use

### **Quick Start:**
1. **Configure:** `python configure_tokens.py`
2. **Install:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Setup Google Drive API** (see SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md)
4. **Run:** `python video_downloader_to_gdrive.py`

### **What Happens:**
- Script reads your CSV with 22 video ads
- Gets real video URLs from Meta API
- Downloads each video with clean filenames like:
  - `TurnedYellow_120208078493940109_David_Influencer_Video.mp4`
  - `MakeMeJedi_295772075784587301_Jedi_Master_Training.mp4`
- Uploads to your Google Drive folder
- Updates CSV with Google Drive links
- Cleans up local downloads

## üìä Expected Results

**Before:** 22 ads with fb.me redirect links
**After:** 22 ads with:
- ‚úÖ Direct Meta video URLs  
- ‚úÖ Google Drive download links
- ‚úÖ Google Drive view links
- ‚úÖ Download status for each

## üéÅ Alternative Options

If you prefer manual control, the script also provides:

1. **Direct Meta URLs** you can use with:
   - `yt-dlp "VIDEO_URL"`
   - `wget "VIDEO_URL" -O filename.mp4`
   - Browser downloads

2. **Batch Processing** - run script periodically for new ads

3. **Custom Folders** - organize by campaign, performance, etc.

## üîí Security & Privacy

- Uses your existing Meta API token
- Google Drive files are privately shared (you control permissions)
- Local downloads are automatically cleaned up
- All credentials stored securely

## üìà Benefits

1. **Easy Access**: Direct download links instead of Facebook redirects
2. **Organization**: Videos organized in Google Drive with clear names
3. **Backup**: Your ads are safely stored in your Google Drive
4. **Scalable**: Script can handle new ads as you create them

## üéØ Next Steps
